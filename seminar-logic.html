On Representations of Intended Structures in Foundational Theories
<br><br>
Abstract: Often philosophers, logicians, and mathematicians employ a notion of intended 
structure when talking about a branch of mathematics. In addition, we know that there are 
foundational mathematical theories that can find representatives for the objects of informal 
mathematics. In this paper, we examine how faithfully foundational theories can represent 
intended structures, and show that this question is closely linked to the decidability of 
the theory of the intended structure. Joint work with Neil Barton and Moritz Muller.

<br>DELP: Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Security Protocols
<br><br>
Abstract: The formal analysis of security protocols is a challenging field, with various approaches 
being studied nowadays. The famous Burrows-Abadi-Needham Logic was the first logical system aiming to 
validate security protocols. Combining ideas from previous approaches,  in this paper we define a complete 
system of dynamic epistemic logic for modeling security protocols.  Our logic  is implemented, and few of 
its properties are verifyied, using the theorem prover Lean.

A Rewriting-based Toolset for Specification Processing
<br><br>
Abstract: We explore some of the features that promote term rewriting
and, in particular, Maude as a meta-language for working with logical
systems, and showcase a set of rewriting-based tools that support the
syntactic analysis and processing of formal specifications. Along the
way, we discuss basic aspects related to the development of
interpreters of specification languages, including user-interface
design, parsing specifications, and executing commands. All this is
done in a logic-agnostic manner, meaning that the techniques we
describe apply to a wide variety of logical formalisms. To illustrate
the approach, we introduce SpeX, a general platform for working with
formal specifications, and demonstrate the steps required for
integrating new logical formalisms within SpeX.

Inductive and Coinductive Reasoning with Isabelle/HOL
<br><br>
Abstract: I will describe basic and advanced mechanisms for inductive
and coinductive reasoning available in the interactive theorem prover
Isabelle/HOL. They cover inductive and coinductive predicates founded
on Knaster-Tarski fixed points, inductive and coinductive datatypes,
structural recursion and corecursion, corecursion "up-to" and mixed
recursion-corecursion. The concepts will be illustrated with examples
formalized in Isabelle, but they should be understandable to computer
scientists, logicians and mathematicians with no knowledge of
Isabelle.

Experimental Mathematics by Rewriting
<br><br>
Abstract: This talk is about how to support mathematical investigation and development through machine 
performed computational experiments. Its unique character lies in a computational method and its 
associated programming technique.  
This is based an extended form of model-theoretic rewriting which includes some powerful 
features such as non-determinism and rule-based programming. It is also universal in the sense 
that that it is applicable in principle to a wide variety of mathematical domains. Its solid and 
transparent mathematical and logical foundations lead to a programming experience that is very 
close to doing mathematics, which means it is much more suitable for mathematicians than other 
forms of do-it-yourself programming.  The talk will touch directly two aspects of this 
activity: model-theoretic foundations and case studies.

The Entailment Problem in Separation Logic 
(advances amid the pandemic)
<br><br>
Abstract: Separation Logic (SL) is an expressive logic used to describe memory shapes (heaps) 
mutated by pointer programs. The SL entailment problem asks, given two separating conjunctions 
of equational (equality and disequality) and spatial (points-to and predicate) atoms, whether 
all models of the first formula are also models of the second. In general, this problem is 
undecidable. The most general decidable fragment is defined by two syntactic conditions 
(progress and connectivity) ensuring that every model of a predicate atoms can be decomposed 
into a backbone (a tree isomorphic with the unfolding tree of the recursive predicate) and 
several edges between nodes in the backbone. In addition, we require a decidable semantic 
condition (establishment) that requires all existentially quantified variables created during 
unfolding to be associated with backbone cells. The talk presents recent results (2020-2021) 
and is divided in three parts: <br>
(1) We explain why the connectivity and establishment conditions 
are necessary (removing each one of them leads to undecidability). <br>
(2) We show that the 
progressing, connected and established fragment is 2EXP-complete. <br>
(3) We present a generalization of Separation Logic to logical structures (with arbitrary 
number of relational symbols), whose entailment problem is also 2EXP-complete. 
This latter logic is used to reason about reconfigurable distributed systems, instead of pointer programs.

<br>On the Erd&ouml;s-Szekeres Conjecture
<br><br>
Abstract: In 1935, Erd&ouml;s and Szekeres proved that for every integer $k$ greater than $3$, 
there is a minimal integer $n$, such that any set of n points in the plane in general position 
contains $k$ points in convex position, that is, they are the vertices of a convex  $k$-gon. 
Recent advances are: a reduced upper bound for $n$ and a computer solution for $k = 6$. 
We propose a new approach that validates the conjecture for $k = 7$.
