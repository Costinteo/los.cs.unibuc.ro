On Representations of Intended Structures in Foundational Theories
<br><br>
Abstract: Often philosophers, logicians, and mathematicians employ a notion of intended 
structure when talking about a branch of mathematics. In addition, we know that there are 
foundational mathematical theories that can find representatives for the objects of informal 
mathematics. In this paper, we examine how faithfully foundational theories can represent 
intended structures, and show that this question is closely linked to the decidability of 
the theory of the intended structure. Joint work with Neil Barton and Moritz Muller.

<br>DELP: Dynamic Epistemic Logic for Security Protocols
<br><br>
Abstract: The formal analysis of security protocols is a challenging field, with various approaches 
being studied nowadays. The famous Burrows-Abadi-Needham Logic was the first logical system aiming to 
validate security protocols. Combining ideas from previous approaches,  in this paper we define a complete 
system of dynamic epistemic logic for modeling security protocols.  Our logic  is implemented, and few of 
its properties are verifyied, using the theorem prover Lean.

A Rewriting-based Toolset for Specification Processing
<br><br>
Abstract: We explore some of the features that promote term rewriting
and, in particular, Maude as a meta-language for working with logical
systems, and showcase a set of rewriting-based tools that support the
syntactic analysis and processing of formal specifications. Along the
way, we discuss basic aspects related to the development of
interpreters of specification languages, including user-interface
design, parsing specifications, and executing commands. All this is
done in a logic-agnostic manner, meaning that the techniques we
describe apply to a wide variety of logical formalisms. To illustrate
the approach, we introduce SpeX, a general platform for working with
formal specifications, and demonstrate the steps required for
integrating new logical formalisms within SpeX.

Inductive and Coinductive Reasoning with Isabelle/HOL
<br><br>
Abstract: I will describe basic and advanced mechanisms for inductive
and coinductive reasoning available in the interactive theorem prover
Isabelle/HOL. They cover inductive and coinductive predicates founded
on Knaster-Tarski fixed points, inductive and coinductive datatypes,
structural recursion and corecursion, corecursion "up-to" and mixed
recursion-corecursion. The concepts will be illustrated with examples
formalized in Isabelle, but they should be understandable to computer
scientists, logicians and mathematicians with no knowledge of
Isabelle.

Experimental Mathematics by Rewriting
<br><br>
Abstract: This talk is about how to support mathematical investigation and development through machine 
performed computational experiments. Its unique character lies in a computational method and its 
associated programming technique.  
This is based an extended form of model-theoretic rewriting which includes some powerful 
features such as non-determinism and rule-based programming. It is also universal in the sense 
that that it is applicable in principle to a wide variety of mathematical domains. Its solid and 
transparent mathematical and logical foundations lead to a programming experience that is very 
close to doing mathematics, which means it is much more suitable for mathematicians than other 
forms of do-it-yourself programming.  The talk will touch directly two aspects of this 
activity: model-theoretic foundations and case studies.

On extracting variable Herbrand disjunctions
<br><br>
Abstract: Some quantitative results obtained by proof mining take the form of Herbrand disjunctions 
that may depend on additional parameters. We attempt to elucidate this fact through an extension 
to first-order arithmetic of the proof of Herbrand's theorem due to Gerhardy and Kohlenbach which 
uses the functional interpretation. <br>

A short story on logics with typed modalities
<br><br>
Abstract: We introduce a family of modal logics aimed at modeling discrete evolutionary systems. 
These are extensions of ordinary equational and relational logics with typed modalities. 
Unlike the classical notion of modality, typed modalities have the advantage of keeping track 
of changes of system configurations. We employ inner types to capture triggers of changes and 
outer types to capture outcomes. As an example, we model the biological process of membrane 
budding. We discuss some implementation details and glance at connections with the theory of bigraphs.

<br>Verifying the Conversion into CNF in Dafny
<br><br>
Abstract: We present two computer-verified implementations of the CNF conversion for propositional logic. 
The two implementations are fully verified: functional correctness and termination is machine-checked 
using the Dafny language for both. The first approach is based on repeatedly applying a set of 
equivalences and is often presented in logic textbooks. The second approach is based on Tseitinâs 
transformation and is more efficient. We present the main ideas behind our formalization and we 
discuss the main difficulties in verifying the two algorithms.<br><br>

<br>Halpern and Mann iterative schemas: A path towards generalization
<br><br>
Abstract: In this talk I shall discuss recent joint work with Bruno Dinis, where we considered an 
iterative schema which alternates between Halpern and Krasnoselskii-Mann style iterations. We prove, 
under suitable conditions, the strong convergence of this algorithm in the general nonlinear setting 
of CAT(0) spaces. Besides obtaining quantitative information, we will see how such a proof was 
made possible by techniques and ideas from the proof mining program. Our results generalize recent 
work by Bo&#539;, Csetnek and Meier, and Cheval and Leu&#351;tean.

Modal frame incompleteness. An account through second order logic
<br><br>
Abstract: Propositional modal logic is usually viewed as a generalization and extension of 
propositional classical logic. The main argument of this paper is that a good case can be made 
that modal logic should be construed as a restricted form of second order classical logic. 
The paper makes use of the embedding of modal logic in second order logic and henceforth it 
goes on examining one aspect of this second order connection having to do with an incompleteness 
phenomenon. The leading concept is that modal incompleteness is to be explained as a kind of 
exemplification of standard order incompleteness. More- over the modal incompleteness phenomenon 
is essentially rooted in the weaker expressive power of the language of sentential modal logic 
as compared to the stronger expressive power of the language of second order logic.

Notes on abundant elements in union-closed sets
<br><br>
Abstract:  In this presentation we explore an elementary problem, posed by Peter Frankel in 1979, a problem that is still open.
The main attraction of the problem resides in its simple formulation: any finite union-closed family of sets ${\mathcal A}$ has an element 
that is contained in at least half of the member-sets. A family ${\mathcal A}$ of sets is union-closed if for every two member-sets 
$A_1$, $A_2$ from ${\mathcal A}$, the union is also contained in ${\mathcal A}$.

Kripke Semantics for Intuitionistic Lukasiewicz Logic
<br><br>
Abstract:  This paper proposes a generalization of the Kripke semantics of intuitionistic 
logic $\mathbf{IL}$ appropriate for intuitionistic Åukasiewicz logic $\mathbf{IÅL}$ â a logic in 
the intersection between $\mathbf{IL}$ and (classical) 
Åukasiewicz logic. This generalised Kripke semantics is based on the poset sum construction, 
used in Bova and Montagna (Theoret Comput Sci 410(12):1143â1158, 2009) to show the decidability 
(and PSPACE completeness) of the quasiequational theory of commutative, integral and bounded 
GBL algebras. The main idea is that $w \Vdash \psi$âwhich for $\mathbf{IÅL}$ is a relation 
between worlds $w$ and formulas $\psi$, and can be seen as a function taking values in 
the booleans $(w \Vdash \psi ) \in {{\mathbb {B}}}$âbecomes a function taking values in 
the unit interval $(w \Vdash \psi ) \in [0,1]$. 
An appropriate monotonicity restriction (which we call sloping functions) needs to be put on 
such functions in order to ensure soundness and completeness of the semantics.

The Entailment Problem in Separation Logic (advances amid the pandemic)
<br><br>
Abstract: Separation Logic (SL) is an expressive logic used to describe memory shapes (heaps) 
mutated by pointer programs. The SL entailment problem asks, given two separating conjunctions 
of equational (equality and disequality) and spatial (points-to and predicate) atoms, whether 
all models of the first formula are also models of the second. In general, this problem is 
undecidable. The most general decidable fragment is defined by two syntactic conditions 
(progress and connectivity) ensuring that every model of a predicate atoms can be decomposed 
into a backbone (a tree isomorphic with the unfolding tree of the recursive predicate) and 
several edges between nodes in the backbone. In addition, we require a decidable semantic 
condition (establishment) that requires all existentially quantified variables created during 
unfolding to be associated with backbone cells. The talk presents recent results (2020-2021) 
and is divided in three parts: (1) We explain why the connectivity and establishment conditions 
are necessary (removing each one of them leads to undecidability). (2) We show that the progressing, 
connected and established fragment is 2EXP-complete. (3) We present a generalization of 
Separation Logic to logical structures (with arbitrary number of relational symbols), 
whose entailment problem is also 2EXP-complete. This latter logic is used to reason about 
reconfigurable distributed systems, instead of pointer programs. 
<br>
This talk presents results published at CSL'21 and CADE'21.
