<br>Choice principles and infinities for finitely supported structures
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Finitely supported structures are related to permutation models of 
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with atoms (ZFA) and to the theory of 
nominal sets. They were originally introduced in 1930s by Fraenkel, 
Lindenbaum and Mostowski to prove the independence of the axiom of choice and the other 
axioms in ZFA. We use a set theory defined by the axioms of ZFA set 
theory extended with an additional axiom for finite support. The 
consistency (validity) of choice principles in various models of 
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and of ZFA (including the symmetric 
models and the permutation models) was investigated deeply in the last century.
The choice axiom was proved to be independent from the axioms of ZF and 
ZFA. In the new theory of finitely supported structures, we analyze the 
consistency of various choice principles (and equivalent/related 
results), as well as the consistency of results regarding cardinality 
and infinity. We prove the inconsistency of choice principles for 
finitely supported structures (i.e., their formulations with respect to 
the finite support requirement are not valid).
Related to this inconsistency of choice principles, we present some 
pairwise non-equivalent definitions for the notion of infinity 
(difficult to imagine, we have seven forms of infinity for finitely 
supported structures). We compare these forms, and present examples of 
atomic sets satisfying a certain form of infinity, while they do not 
satisfy others. In particular, we focus on the notion of Dedekind 
infinity and on uniformly supported sets.

<br>Rational Synthesis in the Commons with Careless and Careful Agents
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Turn-based multi-agent games on graphs are games where the states are controlled by a single 
player who decides which edge to follow. Each player has a temporal objective that he tries 
to achieve, and one player is the designated `controller', whose objective captures the 
desirable outcomes of the whole system. Cooperative rational synthesis is the problem of 
computing a Nash equilibrium (w.r.t. the individual temporal objectives) that satisfies the 
controller’s objective. In this presentation, we tackle this problem in the context where 
each action has a cost or a benefit on one shared common pool energy resource.
The paper investigates the problem of synthesizing the controller such that there exists 
an individually rational behavior of all the agents that satisfies the controller's objective 
and does not deplete the resource. We consider two types of agents: careless and careful. 
Careless agents only care for their temporal objective, while careful agents also pay attention 
not to deplete the system's resource. We study the complexity of the problem of cooperative 
rational synthesis with parity or Büchi objectives, careful or careless agents, and costs 
encoded in binary or unary.

<br>Functional interpretations for nonstandard arithmetic
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
In the past few years there has been a growing interest in trying to make explicit constructive 
aspects of nonstandard methods with the use of functional interpretations.

Functional interpretations are maps of formulas from the language of one theory into the 
language of another theory, in such a way that provability is preserved. These interpretations 
typically replace logical relations by functional relations. Functional interpretations have 
many uses, such as relative consistency results, conservation results and extraction of 
computational content from proofs.

After giving a short introduction to nonstandard analysis, I will present several recent 
functional interpretations in the context of nonstandard arithmetic as well as some results 
that come from these interpretations.

<br>Kernelization, Proof Complexity and Social Choice
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:  We display an application of the notions of kernelization and data
reduction from parameterized complexity to proof complexity:
Specifically, we show that the existence of data reduction rules for a
parameterized problem having (a). a small-length reduction chain, and
(b). small-size (extended) Frege proofs certifying the soundness of
reduction steps  implies the existence of subexponential size
(extended) Frege proofs for propositional formalizations of the given
problem.

We apply our result to infer the existence of subexponential Frege and
extended Frege proofs for a variety of problems. Improving earlier
results of Aisenberg et al. (ICALP 2015), we show that propositional
formulas expressing (a stronger form of) the Kneser-Lovasz Theorem
have polynomial size Frege proofs for each constant value of the
parameter $k$. Previously only quasipolynomial bounds were known (and
only for the ordinary Kneser-Lovasz Theorem).

Another notable application of our framework is to impossibility
results in computational social choice: we show that, for any fixed
number of agents, propositional translations of the Arrow and
Gibbard-Satterthwaite impossibility theorems have subexponential size
Frege proofs. <br>

<br>(Co)Initial (Co)Algebra Semantics in Matching Logic 
</b> </font>

<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:  Matching logic is a unifying foundational logic for defining formal programming 
language semantics, which adopts a minimalist design with few primitive constructs
that are enough to express all properties within a variety of logical systems, 
including FOL, separation logic, (dependent) type systems, modal 
mu-logic, and more.
In this presentation, we will show how the initial algebra semantics and the
final (coinitial) coalgebra semantics are captured as theories in Matching 
Logic. The presentation will be examples-based. <br>

<br>Adaptive Virtual Organisms: A Compositional Model for Complex Hardware-software Binding
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The relation between a structure and the function it runs is of interest in
 many fields, including computer science, biology (organ vs. function) and psychology (body vs. mind). 
Our paper addresses this question with reference to computer science recent hardware and 
software advances, particularly in areas as Robotics, Self-Adaptive Systems, IoT, CPS, 
AI-Hardware, etc.
<br>
At the modelling, conceptual level our main contribution is the introduction of the concept 
of ``virtual organism" (VO), to populate the intermediary level between reconfigurable hardware 
agents and intelligent, adaptive software agents. A virtual organism has a structure, 
resembling the hardware capabilities, and it runs low-level functions, implementing the 
software requirements. The model is compositional in space (allowing the virtual organisms 
to aggregate into larger organisms) and in time (allowing the virtual organisms to get 
composed functionalities).
<br>
The virtual organisms studied here are in 2D (two dimensions) and their structures are described 
by 2D patterns (adding time, we get a 3D model). By reconfiguration, an organism may change 
its structure to another structure in the same 2D pattern. We illustrate the VO concept 
with a few increasingly more complex VO’s dealing with flow management or a publisher-subscriber 
mechanism for handling services. We implemented a simulator for a VO, collecting flow over 
a tree-structure (TC-VO), and the quantitative results show reconfigurable structures are 
better suited than fixed structures in dynamically changing environments.
<br>
Finally, we briefly show how Agapia - a structured parallel, interactive programming language 
where dataflow and control flow structures can be freely mixed - may be used for getting 
quick implementations for VO’s simulation.

<br>An Introduction to Protocols in Dynamic Epistemic Logic

<b>Abstract</b>: Dynamic epistemic logics are useful in reasoning about knowledge and acts 
of learning, seen as epistemic actions. However, not all epistemic actions are allowed to 
be executed in an initial epistemic model, and this is where the concept of a protocol 
comes in: a protocol stipulates what epistemic actions are allowed to be performed in a 
model. The aim of my presentation is to introduce the audience to two accounts of protocols 
in DEL:  Hoshi's [1], and Wang's [2].

<br>Regular matching problems for infinite trees
</b> </font>

<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:  We study the matching problem ``$\exists\sigma:\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?" where
$L,R$ are regular tree languages over finite ranked alphabets $X$ and $\Sigma$ respectively, 
and $\sigma$ is a substitution such that $\sigma(x)$ is a set of trees in 
$T(\Sigma\cup H)\setminus H$ for all $x\in X$. Here, $H$ denotes a set of holes which are 
used to define a concatenation of trees. Conway studied this problem in the special case 
for languages of finite words in his classical textbook ``Regular algebra and finite machines" 
and showed that if $L$ and $R$ are regular, then the problem ``$\exists \sigma:\forall x\in
X:\sigma(x)\neq\emptyset\wedge\sigma(L)\subseteq R$?" is decidable. Moreover, there are only 
finitely many maximal solutions, which are regular and
effectively computable. We extend Conway's results when $L,R$ are regular
languages of finite and infinite trees, and language substitution is applied
inside-out. We show that if $L\subseteq T(X)$ and $R\subseteq T(\Sigma)$ are
regular tree languages then the problem ``$\exists\sigma\forall x\in
X:\sigma(x)\neq\emptyset\wedge\sigma_{io}(L)\subseteq R$?" is decidable.
Moreover, there are only finitely many maximal solutions, which are regular and
effectively computable. The corresponding question for the outside-in extension
$\sigma_{oi}$ remains open, even in the restricted setting of finite trees. Our
main result is the decidability of ``$\exists\sigma:\sigma_{io}(L)\subseteq R$?"
if $R$ is regular and $L$ belongs to a class of tree languages closed under
intersection with regular sets. Such a special case pops up if $L$ is
context-free.

<br>A proof mining case study on the unit interval
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:  In 1991, Borwein and Borwein [1] proved the following: if 
$L>0$, $f:[0,1] \to [0,1]$ is $L$-Lipschitz, $(x_n)$, $(t_n) \subseteq [0,1]$ are such 
that for all $n$, $x_{n+1}=(1-t_n)x_n +t_nf(x_n)$ and there is a $\delta>0$ such that for 
all $n$, $t_n \leq \frac{2-\delta}{L+1}$, then the sequence $(x_n)$ converges.

The relevant fact here is that the main argument used in their proof is of a kind that 
hasn't been analyzed yet from the point of view of proof mining, and thus it may serve as 
an illustrative new case study. We shall present our work on the proof [2], showing how to 
extract a uniform and computable rate of metastability for the above family of sequences.

<br>Unwinding of proofs
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The unwinding of proofs program dates back to Kreisel in the fifties and 
rests on the following broad question: 
``<i>What more do we know if we have proved a theorem by restricted means than if we 
merely know that it is true?</i>"

This research program has since been dubbed proof mining and has been greatly developed during the last 
two decades and emerged as a new form of applied proof theory [1,2]. Through the use of proof-theoretical 
tools, the proof mining program is concerned with the unveil of hidden finitary and combinatorial content 
from proofs that use infinitary noneffective principles.

In this talk, we set out to give a brief introduction to the proof mining program, focusing on the following points:
<ul>
<li> functional interpretations in an introductory way;</li>
<li>the bounded functional interpretation [3,4];</li>
<li> a concrete translation example: the metric projection argument.</li>
</ul>
We finish with a brief discussion of some recent results [5,6].

<br>Formalizing Go&#776;del's System $T$ in Lean
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In 1958, Go&#776;del introduced his functional interpretation as a method 
of reducing the consistency of first-order arithmetic to that of a quantifier-free system 
of primitive recursive functionals of higher type. His work has since enabled other advances 
in proof theory, notably the program of proof mining. We give a brief overview of Go&#776;del's 
system $T$ and then explore a formalization thereof as a deep embedding in the Lean proof assistant.

<br>An introduction to Lean
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Lean is a proof assistant and programming language developed by Leonardo 
de Moura at Microsoft Research starting from 2013, based on dependent types and 
Coquand's Calculus of Inductive Constructions. It offers typical functional programming 
features, as well as a rich and extensible tactic language for writing proofs.
The standard library, mathlib [1], implements an ever-increasing number of definitions 
and theorems, from basic facts about real numbers to more advanced topics like algebraic 
geometry or category theory, providing a structured framework for formalizing mathematics.
We present an introduction to Lean's theory, methods of writing proofs and then look at 
how concrete mathematics is done in mathlib.

<br>Formal verification of SeL4
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: This presentation introduces the SeL4 system, a microkernel first designed 
in Haskell, whose implementation in C has now a full formal proof of correctness. The focus 
is on the methods used to abstract the C code implementation into Isabelle/HOL theorems: 
syntactic translation, memory model and some abstraction levels added to refine the system 
representation, this involves usage of additional tools like a C-to-Isabelle parser and 
AutoCorres that will be shortly described.

<br>AutoCorres tutorial
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: AutoCorres is a tool for abstracting C code into Isabelle/HOL (Isabelle's 
specialization in Higher Order Logic). This presentation will introduce some basic proof 
rules used in most of the Isabelle's theorems that will be needed to follow some introductory 
exercises of using AutoCorres tool with sample C programs. The study cases cover the following 
topics: proving correctness of programs with loops and proving statements about programs that 
manipulate heap memory.

<br>A quantitative multi-parameter mean ergodic theorem	
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In [1], Avigad, Gerhardy and Towsner  proof-theoretically analyzed 
the classical textbook proof due to Riesz of the mean ergodic theorem for Hilbert spaces in 
order to extract uniform rates of metastability. In [2], Kohlenbach and Leu&#537;tean extracted 
rates from a simplified argument of Garrett Birkhoff that applies to uniformly 
convex Banach spaces.
What we do here [3] is to analyze another proof of Riesz which was inspired by Birkhoff's one 
and which delineates more clearly the role played by uniform convexity. 
The corresponding argument has the advantage that it can be used to prove a more general mean 
ergodic theorem for a finite family of commuting linear contracting operators.

<br>What proof mining is about
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Proof mining is an applied subfield of mathematical logic that aims to analyze 
proofs in mainstream mathematics using tools from proof theory. This area has been largely 
developed in the last couple of decades by the school of Ulrich Kohlenbach (see e.g. 
his monograph [1]). Here, I attempt to gently introduce the field to the working logician, 
by adapting my recent articles on The Proof Theory Blog [2,3].
