\maketitle
A Riesz Space is lattice-ordered linear space over the field $\mathbb{R}$. We will consider finitely presented Riesz Spaces, i.e. quotients of the free Riesz Space over a finite numbers of generators by a finitely generated ideal. Baker-Beynon duality states that the category of finitely presented Riesz Spaces that are quotient of the free object on $n$ generators is equivalent to the dual of the category of polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^n$.\\
We will discuss the main ideas concerning the proof of Baker-Beynon duality in the framework of Riesz MV-algebras, in light of the already existing duality between finitely presented MV-algebras and polyhedra with rational vertexes.
