<br>New coloring problems in graphs</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Various types of colorings for vertices and edges of a graph were introduced 
motivated by interference problems in communication networks, such as radio colorings. But, 
in order to solve interference problems, it can be sufficient to ensure that between every 
pair of nodes there is at least one path on which communication can be made without interference. 
In terms of graphs, this means that any two vertices are connected through a colored path 
satisfying certain constraints. The most known types of connectivity through colored paths 
are rainbow connectivity and proper connectivity. This talk aims to briefly present radio 
colorings and existing types of chromatic connectivity and to provide preliminary results 
on radio connectivity - that is connectivity through radio colored paths.
Also, some complexity results on proper connectivity (which is actually radio connectivity 
for one level of interference) of digraphs are presented, a joint work with Guillaume 
Ducoffe and Alexandru Popa.

<br>Proof mining in convex optimization II: the uniform case</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:We show how each instance of the Proximal Point Algorithm has as an input case 
a "uniform case", which can be abstracted into the definition presented last time. This case 
is of a special interest because the algorithm is then constrained to converge (strongly!) 
to a single possible value. This uniqueness can be quantified into a "modulus of uniqueness" 
(not necessarily explicitly), and then, using a technique pioneered by Eyvind Briseid, one 
can extract full rates of convergence for this family of algorithms even in the presence of 
the law of excluded middle. Alongside these explicit proofs, we shall present both a general 
motivation for proof mining and the schema of application which pertains to the case at hand.
These results are joint work with Lauren&#539;iu Leu&#537;tean and Adriana Nicolae.

<br>Proof mining in convex optimization</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:We present another instance of Kohlenbach's program of proof mining (i.e. obtaining quantitative results out of proofs which are not fully
constructive) in the field of convex optimization.
The concept known as the proximal point algorithm is in actuality a
class of similar algorithms used in that area to compute various
extrema such as zeroes of monotone operators, critical points of
convex functions or fixed points of nonexpansive mappings. We present
general definitions into which all such algorithms can be subsumed,
regardless of what the original method for proving their convergence
had been, as well as quantitative information obtained in an abstract
way for each tractable subclass.
These results are joint work with Lauren&#539;iu Leu&#537;tean and Adriana Nicolae.

<br>A logic-programming approach to graph transformation</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The use of graphs and of rule-based graph transformations for the specification and analysis 
of software systems has a long tradition in computer science. Its focus is on those systems whose states can 
be formalized as graph-like structures, and whose evolution can be presented by means of discrete graph 
reconfigurations. In this talk, we revisit several algebraic approaches to graph transformation from 
the vantage point of the theory of institutions, and we show how graph-transformation frameworks 
can be described in the context of substitution systems. This sets the foundation for conducting 
research into a graph-transformation variant of logic programming that would uniformly accommodate, 
for the first time, both the traditional, well-established operational semantics of graph transformation 
and the more recent denotational semantics of the paradigm, which is still in its very early stages of development.

<br>Predicting Human Personality from Social Media using a Fuzzy Neural Network</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In this work we propose a specific neural network for predicting personality, 
by special type of Fuzzy Gaussian Neural Network (FGNN) understanding that it has so special 
the connections (between the second and third layers) and the operations with the nodes, too. 
We shall propose to apply the FGNN for predicting a users' Big Five personality traits 
(the five factor model of personality) from the public information they share on Facebook. 
The Big Five traits are characterized by the following: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, 
Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. To emphasize the performances of our proposed approach 
for predicting personality we have compared it both with a neural method of regression 
(like Multilayer Perceptron= MP) and with a non-neural approach Multiple Linear Regression 
Model (MLRM). The comparison of FGNN and respectively MP versus MLRM marks both the 
competition nonlinear over linear and of neural over statistical, too. To test the performance 
of the neuro-fuzzy prediction achieved based on FGNN we shall use the Normalized Root Mean 
Square Error (NRMSE). According with the NRMSE criterion, we have achieved that the prediction 
with FGNN is better than with others two methods both over the training lot and over the test lot, too.

<br>Theories of Compositionality. Kit Fine's Semantic Relationism</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The paper is an assessment of compositionality from the vantage point of Kit 
Fine’s semantic relationist approach to meaning. This relationist view is deepening our conception 
about how the meanings of propositions depend not only on the semantic features and roles of each 
separate meaningful unit in a complex but also on the relations that those units hold to each other. 
The telling feature of the formal apparatus of this Finean relationist syntax and semantics, viz. the 
coordination scheme, has some unexpected consequences that will emerge against the background 
of an analogy with the counterpart theoretic semantics for modal languages.

<br>Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems</b> </font><br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Under the strongly believed conjecture that $P \ne NP$, no polynomial
time exact algorithms exist for many important problems with
applications in areas like bioinformatics, network design and string
processing. However, suboptimal solutions (which run in polynomial
time) are most of the times sufficient for practical applications. The
study of approximation algorithms, which is my domain of expertize,
has two major branches: improving the upper bounds (i.e. designing
better approximation algorithms) and proving lower bounds (i.e.
hardness of approximation). Both directions are equally interesting:
the former for providing solutions to NP-hard problems, and the latter
for giving a better understanding on the limits of approximation
algorithms. This talk aims to provide a brief introduction into the
approximation algorithms area and to present two of the NP-hard
problems that I have studied.

<br>Treewidth vs. Treelength</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We present new relationships between treewidth and treelength, that are 
two parameters providing distinct, yet complementary, pieces of information on the closeness 
of a graph to a tree.
Intuitively, treewidth measures how close is the structure of a graph from the structure of 
a tree, whereas treelength measures the minimum distortion of the distances in a graph when 
it is embedded into a tree. These two parameters have important algorithmic applications. 
For instance, there are many Constraint Satisfaction Problems that become tractable if one 
of these two above parameters is bounded for the graph of constraints. So, it is interesting 
to relate them.  On the one hand, cycles (with bounded treewidth but unbounded treelength) 
and complete graphs (with bounded treelength but unbounded treewidth) show that in general, 
there can be no relationship between the two parameters. On the other hand, our main result 
is that removing large cycles and large cliques makes treewidth and treelength comparable. 
More precisely, we prove that treelength is linearly upper-bounded by treewidth on classes 
of graphs with bounded shortest maximal cycle basis. Conversely, treewidth is linearly 
upper-bounded by treelength for all classes of apex-minor free graphs.

<br>Exact and exhaustive Boolean minimization algorithms applied in fuzzy set QCA </b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Unlike the engineering field, where a single minimal solution is sufficient 
to end the boolean minimization process, the social sciences require all possible solutions 
to a given input data. Current mainstream algorithms applied in engineering (like Espresso, 
or newer Scherzo) are known to arrive at a minimal solution using a heuristic approach 
(although they claim to be able to generate exact solutions, as well).
Generally, an exact and especially an exhaustive list of solutions have costs in terms of 
memory used and computer cycles, but there are alternatives to cut down both and deal with 
about 18 inputs at a reasonable speed, using compiled C code.

<br>Knowability and Fitch's Paradox in Dynamic Epistemic Logic </b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The Verificationist Thesis states that all truths are knowable, or, in other words, that there are no transcendent truths. 
The classical translation of this thesis into a modal-epistemic language was proven to be 
paradoxical by showing that the modal-epistemic concept of knowability implies a contradiction 
(the Church-Fitch Paradox). However, using the language and semantical tools of Dynamic 
Epistemic Logic, one can formally define a notion of knowability that does not succumb to paradox. 
As such, I will:
<br>
(1) offer a short introduction to Epistemic Temporal Logic and Temporal Dynamic Epistemic Logic;
<br>
(2) present various formulations of knowability in the language of these Dynamic Epistemic Logics;
<br>
(3) present a personal semantical framework (based on Hoshi's 2009 work in Epistemic Temporal Logic) 
in which to both state and prove the consistency of Edgington's concept of knowability.

<br>Yes, No, Perhaps: A logical introduction to quantum computation</b> </font>

<b>Abstract</b>: 
Quantum computation has suggested new kinds of logic, which are  deeply different both 
from Boolean logic (the logical background of classical computation) and from 
multi-valued (fuzzy) logics.
The most striking feature of quantum computational logic is the introduction in the 
realm of ‘pure logic’ of new and physically motivated connectives (gates) that have neither 
a classical nor  a fuzzy-like analogue. 
In this talk, we will present some of these connectives (in particular, “the square-root of 
negation” and  “the square-root of the identity“) and we will discuss some of their most ‘funny’ 
and  ‘illogical’ properties.

<br> QCA - Qualitative Comparative Analysis. An application of boolean algebra and fuzzy sets</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Boolean algebra has long been recognised as a branch of mathematics which had significant applications 
in engineering, leading to the appearance of the modern computers. Recently, however, it has found 
its way to a very interesting application for the comparative analysis in the social sciences, 
that starts from a specially formatted (calibrated) data, to find a minimal causal combination 
that are necessary and/or sufficient to produce a certain outcome. It does that by using the 
famous Quine-McCluskey algorithm, to compare all possible pairs of minimizable cases, over 
multiple iterations, until nothing else can further be minimized, the surviving combinations 
being called prime implicants. In terms of software implementations there are many products
in various fields, one of those being written in the QCA package in R, that is mathematically 
proven to be exact and exhaustive. The usage of fuzzy sets is particularly interesting in this 
procedure, both for the calibration of the original variables and also for the overall 
significance of the necessity and sufficiency concepts, by calculating the so called inclusion and coverage scores.

<br> Independence-Friendly logic (IF logic): the main ideas and technical results </b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
IF logic has been introduced by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in 1989. It is an extension 
of ordinary first-order logic with quantifiers of the form '$Qx/Y$'  where $Y$ is a finite set 
of variables  and $Q$  stands for either the existential or the universal quantifier. When $Y$ 
is empty, we recover the standard quantifiers. The intended interpretation of '$Qx/Y$' is: the 
choice of a value for the variable x (from the underlying universe of discourse) is informationally 
independent of the choices of values for the variables in the set $Y$. The idea of informational 
independence comes from game-theory (games of imperfect information). IF logic has been the motivating 
force for several logics of dependence and independence that have flourished recently 
(Dependence Logics, Inclusion Logics, Independence Logics, Modal Dependence Logics, etc). 
I will present some of the main ideas and some of the technical results, including the probabilistic 
interpretation of IF sentences, which connects to many-valued logics.

logical system, the kind of which is used in proof mining, a research program that aims to 
obtain the hidden computational content of mathematical proofs using tools from mathematical 
logic. The axiomatization is followed by a corresponding metatheorem in the style of proof mining. 
We illustrate its use with an application, namely the derivation of the standard modulus of uniform convexity.
