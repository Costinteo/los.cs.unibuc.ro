\maketitle
 We will continue our study on Modified realizability, and we will present a few important results about it:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item  \emph{Soundness theorem of modified realizability}, which allows us to obtain (provable in ${\bf E-HA}^\omega$) realizers for a formula $A$, provided we can prove $A$ in ${\bf E-HA}^\omega +{\rm AC} +{\rm IP}^\omega_{\rm ef}$. (Here ${\rm AC}$ is the axiom of choice principle, and ${\rm IP}^\omega_{\rm ef}$ is the independence of premise principle for $\exists$-free formulas).
 \item \emph{Characterization theorem for modified realizability}.
 \item \emph{Main theorem on program extraction by modified realizability}, which, in ${\bf E-HA}^\omega+{\rm AC}+{\rm IP}^\omega_{\rm ef}$, from a proof of $\forall x \exists y A(x,y)$, allows us to extract a term $t$ such that we can prove $\forall x  A(x,tx)$, for any formula $A$ in $\mathcal{L}({\bf E-HA}^\omega)$. 
\end{enumerate}
We will finish with some applications of modified realizability.
