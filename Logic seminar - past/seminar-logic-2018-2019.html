<br>Bounds on strong unicity for Chebyshev approximation with bounded coefficients
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In the early 1990s, Kohlenbach pursued a program of applying proof-theoretic 
techniques in order to obtain effective results in best approximation theory, specifically moduli 
of uniqueness and constants of strong unicity. This was part of a larger research program of Kreisel 
from the 1950s called ‘unwinding of proofs’, a program that aimed at applying proof transformations to 
potentially non-constructive proofs in ordinary mathematics in order to extract new information. 
The program was later developed by Kohlenbach and his students and collaborators under the name of 
‘proof mining’, extending it to a variety of mathematical areas.
<br>
What we do is to build upon the work mentioned above in order to obtain a modulus of uniqueness 
for best uniform approximation with bounded coefficients, as first considered by Roulier and Taylor. 
The main novelty is the application of Schur polynomials to obtain useful explicit formulas for 
the interpolation results which are needed in the proof. We present ways these formulas may be 
bounded and how those bounds may in turn be used to derive and verify the desired modulus.

<br>Protocols in Dynamic Epistemic Logic
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: 
Dynamic epistemic logics are useful in reasoning about knowledge and certain acts of learning 
(epistemic actions). However, not all epistemic actions are allowed to be executed in an initial 
epistemic model, and this is where the concept of a protocol comes in: a protocol stipulates what 
epistemic actions are allowed to be performed in a model. The aim of my presentation is to introduce
the audience to two accounts of protocols in DEL: one based on [1], and the second on [2].

<br>An introduction to hybrid-dynamic first-order logic
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>:
We propose a hybrid-dynamic first-order logic as a formal foundation for specifying and reasoning about 
reconfigurable systems. As the name suggests, the formalism we develop extends (many-sorted) first-order logic 
with features that are common to hybrid and to dynamic logics. This provides certain key advantages 
for dealing with reconfiguration, such as: (a) a signature of nominals, including operation and relation 
symbols, that allows references to specific possible worlds / system configurations – as in the case of 
hybrid logics; (b) distinguished signatures of rigid and flexible symbols, where the rigid symbols are 
interpreted uniformly across possible worlds – this supports a rigid form of quantification, which ensures 
that variables have the same interpretation regardless of the possible world where they are evaluated; 
(c) hybrid terms, which increase the expressive power of the logic in the context of rigid symbols; and (d) 
modal operators over dynamic-logic actions, which are defined as regular expressions over binary nominal relations. 
In this context, we advance a notion of hybrid-dynamic Horn clause and develop a series of results 
that lead to an initial-semantics theorem for the Horn-clause fragment of hybrid-dynamic first-order logic.

<br>The hybridization of many-sorted polyadic modal logic

<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: Hybrid logics are obtained by enriching modal logics with  nominals and state variables, that 
directly refer the individual points in a Kripke model.
In the present work we develop a hybrid version on top of our many-sorted polyadic logic, previously defined. 
Our system has  nominals and state variables on each sort, as well as binders that act like the universal and the existential 
quantfiers on state variables.  In doing this, we follow various approaches for hybrid modal logic, especially the work of
Blackburn and Tsakova.

<br>An introduction to BAN logic (a logic of authentication)

<b>Abstract</b>: One of the first and most discussed logical approaches to the problem of 
verifying security protocols is the one proposed in BAN logic (Burrows, Abadi & Needham 1989), 
a many-sorted modal logic used for its intuitive and compelling set of inference rules devised 
for reasoning about an agent’s beliefs, trust and message exchange. My presentation will focus on 
(1) presenting the language and inference rules of BAN logic, 
(2) following the original paper's analysis of the Otway-Rees protocol, 
(3) presenting some objections to using BAN, and 
(4) discussing the problem of offering a semantics of BAN logic.

<br>The frontier between decidability and undecidability for logics for strategic reasoning in the presence of imperfect information
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The last 15-20 years have seen a number of logical formalisms that focus on strategic reasoning. 
These logics aim at giving specification languages for various multi-agent game structures, 
in which agents have adversarial or cooperative objectives which may be qualitative or 
quantitative and may have various types of imperfect information. The presence of imperfect 
information raises a particular difficulty in that many games cannot be solved algorithmically, 
as well as their corresponding logical formalisms. In this tutorial I will review some techniques 
for proving that the Alternating-time Temporal Logic has an undecidable model-checking problem, 
but this problem becomes decidable when considering memoryless strategies, coalitions with 
distributed knowledge, hierarchical knowledge and public or coalition-public announcements. 
I will also give a short introduction to the model-checking tool MCMAS which relies on 
the memoryless semantics for ATL with imperfect information, and the problems that arise when 
implementing the model-checking algorithms for this case.

<br>The finitary content of sunny nonexpansive retractions
</b> </font>
<br><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: The goal of proof mining is to extract quantitative information out of proofs 
in mainstream mathematics which are not necessarily fully constructive. Often, such proofs make 
use of strong mathematical principles, but a preliminary analysis may show that they are 
not actually needed, so the proof may be carried out in a system of strength corresponding 
roughly to first-order arithmetic. Following a number of significant advances in this vein 
by Kohlenbach in 2011 and by Kohlenbach and Leu&#537;tean in 2012, we now tackle a long-standing 
open question: the quantitative analysis of the strong convergence of resolvents in classes 
of Banach spaces more general than Hilbert spaces.
<br>
This result was proven for the class of uniformly smooth Banach spaces by Reich in 1980. 
What we do is to analyze a proof given in 1990 by Morales, showing that adding the hypothesis 
of the space being uniformly convex, and thus still covering the case of $L^p$ spaces, can serve 
to eliminate the strongest principles used in the proof by way of a modulus of convexity for 
the squared norm of such spaces. A further procedure of arithmetization brings the proof down 
to System $T$ so the proper analysis may proceed. After obtaining a non-effective realizer of 
the metastability statement, this is majorized in order to obtain the desired rate. 
Subsequent considerations calibrate this bound to $T_1$. It particular, this result completes 
some analyses that had previously been obtained only partially, yielding rates of metastability 
within the above-considered class of Banach spaces for the Halpern and Bruck iterations.
<br>
These results are joint work with Ulrich Kohlenbach.

<br>Classical and quantum degrees of truth: a new look at the effects of a Hilbert space

<b>Abstract</b>: We investigate certain Brouwer-Zadeh lattices that serve as abstract counterparts 
of lattices of effects in Hilbert spaces under the spectral ordering. These algebras, called 
$PBZ^*$-lattices, can also be seen as generalisations of orthomodular lattices and are remarkable 
for the collapse of three notions of “sharpness” that are distinct in general Brouwer-Zadeh lattices. 
We investigate the structure theory of $PBZ^*$-lattices and their reducts; in particular, we prove 
some embedding results for $PBZ^*$-lattices and provide an initial description of the lattice 
of $PBZ^*$-varieties.

<b>Abstract</b>: KeYmaera X is an automated theorem prover for specifying and verifying 
correctness properties of hybrid systems (systems that combine discrete and continuous dynamics). 
We will present a few examples of real-life hybrid systems using differential dynamic logic 
language. Then we will use KeYmaera X and its axiomatic system to check some of their properties. 
The proof construction will be performed using both KeYmaera X's automated proof search engine and 
by interactively applying axioms from the reduced set of differential dynamic logic axioms that 
includes the first-order logic axioms and proof rules.
