<br><b>Paraconsistent Logic, the Square of Opposition and
Universal Logic</b><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: In this talk I will explain how I have started my research in mathematical logic on paraconsistent logics,
logics which rejected the principle of non contradiction, mainly developed by the Brazilian logician Newton da
Costa. These logics are challenging both from the mathematical and the philosophical point of view, the question is
to have a proper understanding of the notions of contradiction and negation. The theory of oppositions emerging
from the square of opposition is a useful tool giving a general perspective that is fully reached in the realm of
universal logic,a general theory of logical systems that has been developed these last 20 years.

<br><b> The ubiquity of trees: from relative quantifier elimination to deformations of
groups and rings </b><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We consider some relevant contexts where trees and more general arboreal
structures are induced by natural deformations of certain algebraic structures
as valued fields, Pr&uumlfer ring extensions, etc. Some intimate connections
between the induced arboreal structures and the arithmetic and geometric
properties of the original algebraic structures are discussed.

<br><b> Independence-friendly logic and the Monty Hall problem</b><br>
</p>
<b>Abstract</b>: In the first part of the presentation, I will give a short introduction 
to game-theoretical semantics for first-order logic, then move on to the semantics for independence-friendly logic. 
After this introduction, a short discussion on the Monty Hall problem will follow, showing how it has been solved before. 
Finally, I will give the formalization of the Monty Hall scenario and prove that the resulting formula has the same 
value as the probability distribution in the standard solution.

<br><b>Boolean syllogistics</b><br>
</p>
<b>Abstract</b>: The traditional classification of syllogisms into 4 figures is pertinent 
to the formal aspect of reasoning rather than to its essence. It seems to us more appropriate 
to observe that there are 32 syllogistic moods (grouped, if required, into 4 classes corresponding 
to 4 general formulae, each of them including 8 moods); each mood can be given 4 equivalent forms, 
corresponding to  the 4 traditional figures. A few concluding remarks are devoted to the criticisms 
of the moods Darapti, Felapton, Bramantip and Fesapo.

<br> <b>Some progress in 3-SAT</b><br>
</p>
<b>Abstract</b>: Matthias M&uumlller published on the net a C++ code and a text describing the implemented algorithm. 
He claimed that the algorithm "maybe" solves the NP-complete problem 3-SAT in polynomial time. 
The program decided correctly so far the solvability for all instances that have been checked. 
This intriguing fact must be understood.
In order to achieve this goal, we introduce the graph of all possible 3-SAT clauses with edges connecting every two non-conflicting clauses. 
We prove that a 3-SAT instance I is satisfiable if and only if there is a maximal clique of the clause graph that does not intersect I.

<br> <b>Public Announcement Logic</b><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: (1) I will begin my presentation with a very short introduction to Epistemic 
Logic.  (2) Further, I will present the syntax and semantics of Public Announcement Logic, with 
an emphasis on the notion of model-transformers, and the solution to the Muddy Children Puzzle  
(as they are presented in H. van Ditmarsch, B. Kooi and W. van der Hoek's "Dynamic Epistemic Logic"). 
(3) I will present T. Hoshi's notion of a protocol for Public Announcement Logic and analyze the idea 
of introducing operators for changing protocols.

<br> <b>Unit Cost Complexity I</b><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We present the complexity approach started by Blum, Cooker, Shub and Smale 
for the reals and generalized by Poizat for arbitrary structures. In this approach, a structure 
has P = NP for unit cost computations if and only if there is an internal algorithm of fast 
(polynomial time) elimination for the existential quantifier block in formulas E x f(x, y, a), 
where a is a parameter tuple from the structure. Infinite abelian groups and infinite boolean 
rings have the property P =/= NP. Unit cost Knapsack over ordered abelian semigroups with 
cancelation is in P if and only if P = NP classically. If time permits, we will sketch the 
construction of a structure with the property P = NP in the sense of unit cost computations.

<br> <b>Model-theoretic foundations of logic programming</b><br>
<b>Abstract</b>: We review the mathematical foundations of conventional logic programming and advance an 
abstract algebraic framework for it that is grounded on the institution theory of Goguen and Burstall.  
The proposed conceptual structure relies on institutional generalisations of logic-programming notions such 
as variable, substitution, local sentence, interpretation of variables, and satisfaction.  It supports in this way not only a 
definition of logic programs that is independent of the underlying institution, but also the development of an 
equally abstract description of their execution.

<b>Abstract: </b> We briefly review some of the most important results in descriptive 
complexity theory, an area of research whose purpose is to describe complexity classes in 
terms of  model-theoretic constructs (mainly fragments of first- or second-order logic).
Our presentation is aimed towards a logical perspective on the P vs. NP problem.

<br> <b> <a href="Mihai-slides.pdf">Recurent and automatic n-dimensional sequences over finite 
alphabets</a> </b><br>
<b>Abstract: </b> Recurrent n-dimensional sequences over finite alphabets generalize objects 
appearing in computer experiments, like evolution diagrams of cellular automata.  This area of 
research developed constantly in the last 60 years and contains classical works like those of 
Wilson, Conway or Wolfram's "new kind of science", but did never become a mainstream. This can 
be partially explained by the fact that we lack mathematical notions to describe or approximate 
phenomena which are intuitively seen or recognized in those objects. Words like "fractal", "chaos", 
"dynamics", "attractor" are often used in commenting or describing such phenomena, but mostly 
in a non-rigorous way. Another reason might lie in the fact that recurrent n-dimensional 
sequences build a Turing-complete class of objects, so the variety inside the class is really big. <br><br>
Automatic n-dimensional sequences are sequences over finite alphabets produced by deterministic 
finite automata with output, in the sense that a value a(x) is obtained after pushing in 
the automaton a word representing the coordinates x in some chosen base of numeration.<br><br>
It is not known which recurrent n-dimensional sequences are automatic, but some progress in 
this direction will be presented in this talk. Also some some remarcable recurrent 2-dimensional sequences will be shown.
